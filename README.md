Here's your **updated README** with corrections for **React + TypeScript + Vite** instead of Next.js, while keeping everything clean, professional, and informative:

# Skip Hire Selection Interface - Development Approach

## ðŸŽ¯ Project Overview

This project is a modern, responsive React application for skip hire selection, built with **React**, **TypeScript**, **Vite**, and **Tailwind CSS**. The application provides an intuitive interface for customers to browse and select skip hire options with real-time API integration.

---

## ðŸš€ Development Approach

### 1. **Architecture Philosophy**

This project follows a **component-driven development** strategy built on the following principles:

* **Separation of Concerns**: Every file has a clear and distinct purpose
* **Modularity**: Components are reusable, composable, and isolated
* **Type Safety**: Leveraging full TypeScript support for confidence and clarity
* **Performance First**: Built for speed with Vite, minimal re-renders, and responsive UI

### 2. **Project Structure Strategy**

```
src/
â”œâ”€â”€ App.tsx                   # Root component of the application
â”œâ”€â”€ main.tsx                  # Entry point that renders the App
â”œâ”€â”€ index.css                 # Global styles
â”œâ”€â”€ App.css                   # Component-specific styles
â”œâ”€â”€ vite-env.d.ts             # Vite environment types
â”œâ”€â”€ assets/                   # Static assets (e.g., SVGs, images)
â”œâ”€â”€ components/               # Reusable UI components
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ ui/                   # Base UI elements (buttons, inputs, cards, etc.)
â”œâ”€â”€ features/                 # Feature-based folder structure
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ skip-hire-cards/      # Skip Hire Cards feature module
â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ skip-selection-page.tsx     # Main page component
â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ components/                 # Feature-specific components
â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ hooks/                      # Custom hooks for feature logic
â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ services/                   # API calls for this feature
â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ types/                      # TypeScript types for this feature
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ utils/                      # Feature-specific helper functions
â”œâ”€â”€ lib/                      # Shared utility functions
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ utils.ts              # Generic helpers
```

**Rationale**: This structure ensures scalability, maintainability, and clear boundaries between concerns. It supports team collaboration and fast onboarding for new developers.

### 3. **Technical Decisions & Justifications**

#### **Frontend Stack: React + Vite**

* **Why**: Vite provides blazing-fast development and optimized production builds
* **Benefit**: Instant hot module replacement (HMR) and minimal config overhead

#### **TypeScript Integration**

* **Why**: Strong typing prevents runtime bugs and improves editor support
* **Implementation**: All props, hooks, services, and data models use TypeScript interfaces
* **Benefit**: Compile-time safety, cleaner refactoring, and better documentation

#### **Tailwind CSS for Styling**

* **Why**: Utility-first CSS framework enabling rapid and consistent UI development
* **Implementation**: Custom design tokens and reusable utility classes
* **Benefit**: Small CSS footprint, fewer class name collisions, and responsive-first design

#### **Component Library: shadcn/ui**

* **Why**: Accessible and customizable headless UI components
* **Implementation**: Used for consistent UI patterns (e.g., Button, Card, Tabs)
* **Benefit**: Rapid UI development with accessibility and theme consistency built-in

---

### 4. **API Integration Strategy**

#### **Service Layer Pattern**

```ts
// services/skip-api.ts
export async function fetchSkipsByLocation(postcode: string, area: string): Promise<Skip[]> {
  const response = await fetch(`/api/skips?postcode=${postcode}&area=${area}`);
  if (!response.ok) throw new Error("Failed to fetch skip data");
  return response.json();
}
```

* **Why**: Encapsulation of fetch logic keeps components clean and testable
* **Benefit**: Easier to mock during tests and reuse across multiple pages/features
